= Defining Charts

With the `helm` plugin you can configure your Helm chart using a declarative DSL, and the corresponding Gradle
tasks will be added automatically.

Groovy
[source,groovy,subs="+attributes",role="primary"]
----
plugins {
    id 'fr.rozanc.helm' version '{project-version}'
}

helm {
    charts {
        foo {
            chartName = 'foo'
            chartVersion = '1.2.3'
            sourceDir = file('src/helm')
        }
    }
}
----

Kotlin
[source,kotlin,subs="+attributes",role="secondary"]
----
plugins {
    id("fr.rozanc.helm") version "{project-version}"
}

helm {
    charts {
        create("foo") {
            chartName.set("foo")
            chartVersion.set("1.2.3")
            sourceDir.set(file("src/helm"))
        }
    }
}
----

Note that the chart moniker used in the DSL and the actual chart name are not necessarily the same, unless you set
 them to the same value.


The following properties can be configured on a chart:

|===
| Property | Description | Default

| `chartName`
| The name of the chart, as used in various `helm` CLI commands. The plugin will make sure that the chart sources are
  in a directory with this name when calling `helm`.
| Defaults to the name of the chart in the DSL.

| `chartVersion`
| The version of the chart, as used by `helm`.
| Defaults to the Gradle project version.

| `sourceDir`
| The directory containing the chart sources (`Chart.yaml` file, etc.).
| Defaults to `src/main/helm` for the `main` chart (see below), _required_ for all other charts.

| `extraFiles`
| An optional Gradle `CopySpec` that allows injecting files from external sources into the chart.
| By default, no files are copied.
|===


== Helm Chart Tasks

From the above chart definition, a number of tasks will be created automatically:

Task `helmFilterFooChartSources`::
Resolves placeholders in the chart sources.

Task `helmCollectFooChartDependencies`::
Resolves chart dependencies within the project (see <<Managing Chart Dependencies>>).

Task `helmCollectFooChartSources`::
Collects all the sources for a chart (including dependencies and extra files) into one directory.

Task `helmUpdateFooChartDependencies`::
Equivalent to the link:https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_dependency_update/[`helm dependency update`] CLI command.

Task `helmLintFooChart`::
Equivalent to the link:https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_lint/[`helm lint`] CLI command. See <<Linting Charts>> for
details on configuring the linting step.

Task `helmPackageFooChart`::
Equivalent to the link:https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_package/[`helm package`] CLI command.


In addition, the plugin creates a task named `helmPackage` that will depend on all charts' package task, so it can be
used to build all the project's charts. Most of the time, you will just call `helmPackage` to build your charts.


== Helm Chart Configurations

The following configurations and artifacts will be created for each chart:

Configuration `helmFoo`::
Contains a single artifact that has the chart directory as its output, and is built by the
`helmBuildFooChartDependencies` task.

Configuration `helmFooPackaged`::
Contains a single artifact that has the packaged (tar.gz) chart file as its output, and is built by the
`helmPackageFooChart` task.


== Using the `main` chart

For the typical case of building a single Helm chart in a project, the Helm plugin provides some useful conventions
so that a single "main" chart can be built with a minimum of configuration.

If you don't define any charts in the `helm.charts` DSL block, and your project contains a file
`src/main/helm/Chart.yaml`, then by convention a chart named `main` will be
defined automatically, equivalent to the following:

[source,groovy,role="primary"]
.Groovy
----
helm.charts {
    main {
        sourceDir = file('src/main/helm')
    }
}
----

[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
helm.charts {
    create("main") {
        sourceDir.set(file("src/main/helm"))
    }
}
----

WARNING: since Helm chart versions must be SemVer-compliant, you should either make sure that the project version is a
valid SemVer, or set the main chart version to a different value.

The `main` chart will not be instantiated if you define any other charts; however you can create the `main` chart
explicitly if you would like to use it anyway:

[source,groovy,role="primary"]
.Groovy
----
helm.charts.main.chartVersion = '1.0.0'
----

[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
helm.charts.create("main") {
    chartVersion.set("1.0.0")
}
----

[TIP]
====
Some IDEs (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA) offer support for Helm, and will report a warning or error if the `name` declared in
the Chart.yaml file differs from the name of the containing directory. If you want to avoid such a warning, you can
either
  * call your chart `helm` in the Chart.yaml file -- it will automatically be renamed when the chart is packaged; or
  * change the `sourceDir` of the `main` chart to a directory that matches the chart name.
====


== Using Charts in a Multi-Project Build

Of course, instead of defining multiple charts in one Gradle project, you can also have a multi-project build where
each subproject defines a single `main` chart. That way, you can take advantage of the `main` chart convention in
every project.

However, note that the values defined in the `helm` block are not automatically inherited by subprojects.
If you want to define your Helm CLI options in one central place, you can add a `subprojects` clause in the root
project:

[source,groovy,role="primary"]
.Groovy
----
subprojects {
    // Use verbose logging on all Helm commands
    helm.extraArgs.addAll("-v", "1")
}
----

[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
subprojects {
    // Use verbose logging on all Helm commands
    helm.extraArgs.addAll("-v", "1")
}
----


== Adding Extra Files to a Chart

Each chart defined in the DSL has an `extraFiles` property which is a Gradle `CopySpec`. It allows you to copy
additional files into the chart when it is built.

[source,groovy,role="primary"]
.Groovy
----
helm.charts {
    myChart {
        sourceDir = file 'src/helm/my-chart'

        extraFiles {
            from('src/extra/script.js') {
                into('files/scripts')
            }
        }
    }
}
----

[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
helm.charts {
    create("myChart") {
        sourceDir.set(file("src/helm/my-chart"))

        extraFiles {
            from("src/extra/script.js") {
                into("files/scripts")
            }
        }
    }
}
----

In most cases, the source files of the chart should be put into the chart source directory.
The `extraFiles` mechanism is primarily designed for cases where some parts of the chart need to be dynamically
generated during the Gradle build.

TIP: If the `extraFiles` copy spec refers to a `RegularFileProperty` or `DirectoryProperty` that represents the output
of a task, or to an artifact declared by another project, a task dependency will automatically be set up so that the
task building the file is run before the Helm chart is built.
